# 100+ Command Line Tools for Data Visualization

Prepared for my talk at [2022 Outlier](https://outlierconf.com/), but should be useful for all!

While these tools may not all work with data viz directly, they would help with your data visualization *process*. This may include:

- Data cleaning/wrangling
- Exploring a dataset
- Sending/sharing data with others
- Translating/converting a dataset into different filetypes
- Making the terminal not unbearable

Feel free to send suggestions and comments to add new tools and categories!
