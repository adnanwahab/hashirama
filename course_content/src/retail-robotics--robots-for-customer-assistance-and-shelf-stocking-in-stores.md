Creating a comprehensive documentation website for a robotics company focused on retail robotics is a great endeavor. It can greatly benefit from curated content that reflects the latest trends, technologies, and discussions in the field. Here’s a structured plan to gather and present relevant social media content for your documentation site.

### Sourcing and Presenting Social Media Content

1. **Twitter**: 
   - Follow and curate tweets from key industry players, researchers, and companies in the retail robotics sector. Use hashtags like `#RetailRobotics`, `#Automation`, `#RetailTech`, and `#AI` to discover relevant conversations.
   
2. **LinkedIn**: 
   - Monitor posts from industry experts, companies, and publications focused on robotics in retail. Look for articles, status updates, and case studies that discuss innovations in the field.

3. **YouTube**: 
   - Identify channels that focus on robotics and technology. Share insightful videos or webinars that provide educational content or showcase new products in retail environments.

4. **Facebook Groups**: 
   - Join groups dedicated to robotics and retail technology. Participate in discussions to extract valuable insights that can be showcased on your documentation site.

### Example Web Page Structure

To effectively showcase social media content, consider creating a dedicated page or section in your documentation website. Here’s an HTML structure to illustrate how to present this information:

```html

        }
        .container {
            max-width: 800px;
            margin: 0 auto;
            background: white;
            padding: 20px;
            border-radius: 5px;
            box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
        }
        h1, h2 {
