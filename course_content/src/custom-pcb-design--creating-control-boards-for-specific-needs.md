Enhancing your documentation website with visualizations and relevant research on custom PCB design for robotics is an excellent approach to provide value to your users. Below are visualization examples you could create using ObservableHQ, along with links to research papers and resources related to custom PCB design and robotics.

### Visualization Ideas for Your Documentation

1. **Custom PCB Design Process Flowchart**:
   - A flowchart illustrating the steps in the custom PCB design process for robotics can help users understand the workflow.

   [Example Flowchart Visualization](https://observablehq.com/@d3/flowchart-example)

2. **Comparative PCB Design Analysis**:
   - Create charts (scatter plots or bar charts) to compare PCB designs based on metrics like size, cost, and layer count relevant to robotics applications.

   [Scatter Plot Example](https://observablehq.com/@d3/scatter-plot)

3. **Component Utilization in Robotics Control Boards**:
   - Visualize different components (microcontrollers, sensors, etc.) used in control boards and their interconnections.

   [Force-Directed Graph Example](https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph)

4. **PCB Failure Rates Over Time**:
   - A line chart showing failure rates of various PCBs in robotics over time or by manufacturer.
