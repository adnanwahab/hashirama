### Additional Resources

4. **MPC Toolbox for Python**  
   A visualization of the MPC implementation in Python, using libraries like CasADi or do-mpc, which you may find useful for hands-on coding demonstrations.  
   - [do-mpc](https://www.do-mpc.com/) - An open-source toolbox for Model Predictive Control in Python.

5. **Simulating MPC in ROS**  
   This reference implementation details how to integrate MPC with the Robot Operating System (ROS) for robot simulations, including visual demonstrations with RViz.  
   - [ROS MPC Example](http://wiki.ros.org/Robotic_Control) - Resources and examples of MPC in robotic systems.

6. **YouTube Tutorials**  
   Include links to video tutorials that explain the concepts of MPC in a visual format. Videos can often clarify complex topics with practical demonstrations.  
   - [Model Predictive Control Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Go_as15u5E) - This video provides a clear explanation of MPC principles.

### Integration into Documentation

Consider integrating these visualizations into specific sections of your documentation, such as:

- **Introduction to MPC**  
   Use interactive notebooks to give users hands-on experience.

- **Applications of MPC in Robotics**  
   Include videos and simulations relevant to specific robotic applications.

- **Implementation in Code**  
   Link to Python or MATLAB toolboxes and interactive demos that showcase coding MPC.

These resources will enrich your documentation, making it not only more informative but also engaging for users interested in Model Predictive Control in robotics. If you need further assistance or additional resources, feel free to ask!
