### Visualizations and Interaction with Data

You can create dynamic visualizations using **[ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com)**, a platform that allows for interactive data visualization. Below are ideas for visualizations you can develop:

- **Feeding Scheduling Visualization**: Create a timeline visualization showing optimal feeding times based on stray cat behavior and data collected over time regarding feeding frequency and times.
  
- **Feeding Location Mapping**: Use geo-mapping to display areas where stray cats are fed. This can include layers for potential feeding spots and the effectiveness of feeding robots in those areas.

- **Behavioral Analysis Graphics**: Develop histograms or scatter plots to analyze the behaviors of stray cats before and after the introduction of automated feeding systems, using data collected and analyzed from your operations.

### Suggestions for Documentation Integration

- **Related Research Section**: Include these links within a "Related Research" section to lend credibility to your project and provide your users resources for further exploration.

- **Summarize Key Findings**: For each paper, provide a brief summary of its findings that are relevant to automated feeding for stray cats. This will help visitors quickly grasp the significance of the research.

- **Embedded Visualizations**: Create and embed interactive visualizations on your site using ObservableHQ, showcasing data from your projects or insights from the referenced research to engage users.

- **Citation Feature**: Implement a feature that allows users to easily cite these resources in their own research or documentation.

### Example ObservableHQ Link
To demonstrate a specific visualization related to feeding stray cats, here is an example link you can use or adapt:  
- **[Feeding Stray Cats Using Robots - Observable Notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/your_example_notebook_id)**. (Replace with your actual notebook link.)

Lastly, ensure that all resources are accessible to your website visitors, considering any potential access restrictions on academic papers. This will enhance user engagement and provide valuable insights into the use of robotics for animal welfare.
