### Engaging with ObservableHQ

- **Embedding Observable Visualizations**: Use iframe embeds or interactive widgets from ObservableHQ notebooks in your documentation to make the experience hands-on.
- **Explanatory Notes**: Each visualization should be accompanied by simple descriptions or annotations explaining the underlying principles.

### Resources Page

1. **Visualizations and Tools**
   - List all the visualizations available, along with descriptions and links to their respective ObservableHQ notebooks.
 
2. **Documentation Links**
   - Include links to research papers, tutorials, and relevant educational resources about robotics and 3D reconstruction.

3. **Community and Social Media**
   - Provide a feed or links to notable tweets, posts, or updates from thought leaders in the field:
     - Search for keywords like “3D reconstruction robotics” or “latest SLAM research.”
     - Embed selected tweets related to your company's innovations or recent developments in the field.

### Example Tweets to Embed

- Share insights from renowned researchers discussing the latest trends in SLAM or 3D reconstruction.
- Highlight new technology announcements from other companies in the robotics space that could be relevant to your audience.

### Conclusion
By integrating interactive visualizations, clear explanations, relevant resources, and social media connections into your documentation website, you'll create an engaging platform that showcases your robotics company's expertise and commitment to advancing technology in 3D reconstruction. This approach not only enhances the user experience but also raises awareness of the innovations and applications in your field.
