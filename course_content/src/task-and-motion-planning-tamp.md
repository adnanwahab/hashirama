Creating a documentation website that effectively illustrates Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) concepts is a great initiative for a robotics company. Below are detailed suggestions for visualizations and resources that can help bring TAMP concepts to life using ObservableHQ and related tools:

### Visualization Ideas for TAMP

1. **Interactive Flowcharts**:
   - Develop flowcharts illustrating the TAMP process from goal formulation to execution, showing dependencies and decision points. 
   - **Tools**: Use [Visme](https://www.visme.co/), [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/), or [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) for creating dynamic flowcharts.

2. **3D Robot Simulations**:
   - Create immersive 3D simulations that demonstrate robots performing tasks as per the TAMP framework.
   - **Tools**: Explore platforms like [Unity](https://unity.com/) or use [ROS-Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) for robotics simulations.

3. **Task Hierarchies**:
   - Visualize the hierarchical structure of TAMP tasks and subtasks, showing how complex tasks decompose into simpler actions.
   - **Tools**: Use [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) or similar diagramming software to construct task trees.

4. **Path Planning Animations**:
   - Develop animations to illustrate how different path planning algorithms (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s, A*, RRT) operate in practice.
   - **Tools**: Utilize [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) for Python-based animations or create visual demos in JavaScript.

5. **Real-time Motion Planning Visualizations**:
   - Employ [D3.js](https://d3js.org) to create real-time visualizations showing robots navigating through environments with obstacles.
