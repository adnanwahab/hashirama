To create a comprehensive and engaging documentation website for your robotics company, integrating social media content can provide real-time insights and foster community interaction. Below are detailed guidelines to effectively incorporate social media elements into your website based on your requirements.

### Enhancing Your Robotics Documentation Website with Social Media

#### 1. Live Tweet Feed
Integrate a live feed of tweets that highlight the latest news and trends in robotics using a popular hashtag, for example, `#Robotics`. This can make your documentation dynamic and keep your users engaged.

```html
<a class="twitter-timeline" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Robotics" data-tweet-limit="5">Tweets about robotics</a>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

#### 2. Highlighted Tweets
Compile a selection of insightful tweets from key influencers and organizations in the robotics community. This can act as an excellent resource for users looking for expert opinions and breaking news.

- **Innovative Developments**:
  - *“Exploring the frontiers of AI and robotics in healthcare! #AI #Robotics”* - [@TechLeader](https://twitter.com/techleader/status/example)
  
- **Company Announcements**:
  - *“Big news! We’re launching our latest autonomous vehicle next month. Stay tuned! #AutonomousDriving #Robotics”* - [@InnovativeCompany](https://twitter.com/innovativecompany/status/example)

- **Research Breakthroughs**:
  - *“New study reveals how robotics is transforming the agricultural sector! #Agritech #Robotics”* - [@ResearchInstitute](https://twitter.com/researchinstitute/status/example)

#### 3. Video Highlights
Curate relevant video content from platforms like YouTube that showcases innovative robotics technology, talks, or demonstrations. Embed these videos directly, encouraging users to explore further.
