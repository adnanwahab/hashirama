To create an effective documentation website for your robotics company that focuses on behavior prediction using reinforcement learning, integrating social media insights and resources can enhance user engagement. Below is a structured approach, complete with examples for tweets and relevant social media content to include:

### Suggested Structure for Social Media Integration

1. **Expert Insights**: Share tweets or posts from AI and robotics researchers that break down complex topics in reinforcement learning and behavior prediction.

2. **Community Engagement**: Feature discussions on current trends, breakthroughs, and events in the robotics community that are relevant to reinforcement learning.

3. **Educational Resources**: Highlight tutorials, courses, and videos that supplement user learning and understanding of reinforcement learning in robotics.

### Example Tweets and Social Media Links

Here are examples that can be adapted as actual tweets from Twitter or other social media platforms relevant to behavior prediction in robotics:

1. **Insightful Thread on Reinforcement Learning**:  
   Tweet by [@AI_Researcher](https://twitter.com/AI_Researcher/status/1234567890): "Just published my latest research on how reinforcement learning can drastically improve robotic behavior prediction! ðŸ¦¾ #AI #Robotics"

2. **Community Discussion on Latest Trends**:  
   Tweet by [@RoboticsToday](https://twitter.com/RoboticsToday/status/1234567891): "Join our discussion on the impact of reinforcement learning in robotics at this weekâ€™s meet-up! What applications excite you the most? #RoboticsCommunity #RL"

3. **Educational Video Resource**:  
   Tweet by [@EduTech](https://twitter.com/EduTech/status/1234567892): "Looking to master reinforcement learning for robotics? Check out this comprehensive tutorial that covers everything you need! ðŸŽ“ðŸ‘¾ [Link to Video] #Learning #Robotics"

4. **Conference Insights**:  
   Tweet by [@AI_Conference](https://twitter.com/AI_Conference/status/1234567893): "What a fantastic conference! The discussions on integrating reinforcement learning into real-world robotics applications were mind-blowing! #AIConference #ReinforcementLearning"

5. **Interactive Tools for Learning**:

### Additional Recommendations

- **Embed Social Feeds**: Incorporate live Twitter feeds or hashtags (e.g., #ReinforcementLearning, #Robotics) into your website to keep content fresh and relevant.

- **Real-Time Discussions**: Encourage followers and site visitors to engage with hashtags for real-time discussions on behavior prediction in robotics.

- **User Contributions**: Allow users to submit their own relevant findings, articles, or social media posts, which can be featured on your documentation site to foster a sense of community involvement.

By structuring your social media integration with carefully selected content, youâ€™ll not only enhance the usability of your documentation site but will also encourage ongoing engagement within the robotics community focused on reinforcement learning and behavior prediction.
