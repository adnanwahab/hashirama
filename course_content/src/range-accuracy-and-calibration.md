Sure! Here’s how you can enhance the documentation website for your robotics company by incorporating relevant visualizations and links to research papers about range, accuracy, and calibration in robotics.

### Enhancing Documentation with Visualizations and Research Links

#### 1. Interactive Range and Accuracy Visualizations
Create dynamic visualizations using ObservableHQ that allow users to interactively explore the relationship between range and accuracy. Consider incorporating:

- An interactive plot where users can adjust parameters (such as sensor types or calibration methods) to see how they affect accuracy and range.

**Example Embed Code for ObservableHQ:**
```javascript
// ObservableHQ code to create visualization
md`# Range vs. Accuracy Visualization

This interactive visualization illustrates how different factors influence the range and accuracy of robotic sensors.
