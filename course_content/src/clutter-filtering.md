### Robotics Documentation Page Outline

#### 1. Introduction
**Purpose:**  
This section introduces the documentation's aim, highlighting the significance of understanding robotics performance metrics such as speed, accuracy, and cost. It sets the stage for the information and resources that will follow.

---

#### 2. JavaScript Visualization Code
**Integrate Dynamic Filtering and Visualization**  
Include JavaScript code that utilizes ObservableHQ’s clutter-filtering techniques to visualize performance metrics dynamically. This section can feature snippets or a direct reference to ObservableHQ.

```javascript
// Example code from ObservableHQ for filtering and visualizing robotics metrics
import { filterData } from "some-utility-library"; // hypothetical utility for data manipulation

// Insert visualization code here with emphasis on scrollable/filterable data representation

// Sample Data Visualization
const data = [...]; // hypothetical dataset of robotic performance metrics
const filteredData = filterData(data, criteria); // implement filtering logic
```
