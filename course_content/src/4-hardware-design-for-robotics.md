#### 2. Visualization Tools Using ObservableHQ

**Example Visualization Titles:**
- **Robotic Arm Dynamics Visualization**
  - **Link**: [Robotic Arm Dynamics](https://observablehq.com/@user/robotic-arm-dynamics)

- **Real-Time Data from Sensor Networks**
  - **Link**: [Sensor Data in Real-Time](https://observablehq.com/@user/sensor-data-real-time)

- **Comparison of Power Consumption in Different Robotics Designs**
  - **Link**: [Power Consumption Analysis](https://observablehq.com/@user/power-consumption)

*(Update links with actual projects relevant to your documentation.)*

**Visualization Section (HTML):**

```html
<div class="visualizations">
    <h2>Relevant Visualizations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@user/robotic-arm-dynamics" target="_blank">Robotic Arm Dynamics Visualization</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@user/sensor-data-real-time" target="_blank">Real-Time Data from Sensor Networks</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@user/power-consumption" target="_blank">Comparison of Power Consumption in Different Robotics Designs</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

#### 5. Integration into Documentation Website

**CSS for Styling:**

```css
.visualizations, .social-media, .research-links {
    margin: 20px auto;
    width: 70%;
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 8px;
    padding: 15px;
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

h2 {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}

ul {
    list-style-type: none;
    padding: 0;
}

ul li {
    margin: 5px 0;
}
```
