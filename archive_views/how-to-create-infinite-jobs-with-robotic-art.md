# The potential of "robotic art"

how 100% of people can be empowered to

When i first met Kai Wang, I asked him what the most interesting new research in AI said.
After a brief pause, he said Creative AI.
Now about 8 months later, GPT-2 came out, and I got beta access. I actually thought it was useless cause I'm pretty much the same as everyone else.

Like, why would I want a tool that could recolor a button orange in react? when i can just Ctrl-F blue C-w o tab ? that's only 5 presses. and a sentence is 20.

But, now i triple wield emacs, cursor and Zed because they are so cool.

Anyway, i was suprised by that because it had nothing to do with robots, or so i thought.

But actually now everyone should be able to program robots as well as any PHD in Computer vision or someone who trained from child.[1]

Serious question: why don't they just mandate
that public observability of all logs and all
source-code of every business and government
office.

individuals can remain free from this, because a single person can't really do anything in the world on
their own.

But corporations and governments don't have enough accountability.

This would enable citizens and other companies to audit their logs, which would 100% prevent the
possiblity of 99% of wrong doing, intentional or not.

I think most people are good people. They mean well. But due to lack of oversight and feedback,
corporations and governments get away with bloody murder, to the detriment of everyone, even
themselves.

The scariest bad-faith actors are giant companies.

A good example is bayesian spam filtering for email or youtube or twitter. Now this technology is
good because it inhibits a lot of abuse. But it can also be bad, and people have had their livelihoods
shutdown for years with no real recourse. I had a cousin who is 12 who's only source of income was
youtube and he literally just talked about cartoons and his channel got permabanned.

Another case is dating apps. If someone uploads a photo, and the company's data pipeline think's its
a fake picture, you can get banned. And there's not much you can do, even if you appeal they usually
just reinforce their frame onto you with no justification.

Last example, super human robot walks around and accidentally kills someone. This could have been
prevented if all logs and code were public. Self-driving is provably 3 times safer than human drivers,
but I am worried everyday there's a bug that we could have caught, and it hurts someone, and it could
have been caught if the logs and code were public.

This type of mandate can only work if it comes from the top, meaning all governments have to
support it and enforce it on every company and themselves.

I like @anthropic, and i hope they push something like this forward. I have spoken about it at at the office and people think its kinda pie in the sky or too idealistic.

But in my opinion, it would create a world without victims, and possibly without any unnecessary
suffering at all. It could even cause an explosion of progress and knowledge advancement.

I think von neumann would have wanted this. And since we all use his architecture, we should honor
his work by doing what is best for all of humanity.

Some business models might not work, yes. But many more would open up.

I know RMS has been ostracized, but i think he had some good points. I would extend his ideas even
further. He didn't like server software, but i think done this way it would positively influence the world
immeasurably.

Hope that's not too radical or nutty.

I think it would be very important to enable robots to be programmed by 100% of people.

No one really knows how they should work. Isaac Asimov and Eichiro Oda thought that convention methods of roles and permissions, like https://aws.amazon.com/iam/

are good for most things, like financial software, or email or making video games. Because, if there's a problem you make a ticket and it gets eescalated and fixed in a few days.

It may be slow sometimes, but it works and its easy to implement.

But with robots, they are in the real world. and the real world is very complex.

The people who write robots are far from gods.

In my opinion, theres like 1 or two people like Von Neumann out of every billion or so.

The rest of us are pretty average, and it takes time to develop skill and even then we are very fallible.

If you practice for 10 years consitently, you can get to a 60x difference in productivity.

IF you think very deeply and take big risks, you can get to 100x https://paulgraham.com/95.html. If you combine luck with 100x, you get Jan Koum or Zuckerberg and have a 10,000x due to leverage and network effects and winner-take-all dynamics and power laws.

I think it's about time, we insist that 100% of people have the power to get to 100 or 1000x.

That makes no sense because if everyone is 100x then everyone is so then you are back to average ok rewreite

Today, only about .5-2% of people really like writing computer code.

Thats because its kind of error prone, takes a long time and if you miss a semi colon your million line program can break.

a logical bug is bug that a computer cant really catch, but humans write all the time.

All software has bugs. Pretty much 100%.

The primary reason that server software is easy to develop is because when bugs are caught, you can fix them instantly.

[1] we might still want coders to hand craft some ideas, the same way that you might wear a tailored outfit once a week or to a special event.
But 99% of the time, we just wear uniqlo.

if a doctor needs a program made, to do some analysis, he can now mock it out and try it out himself and tweak it as much as he wants.

he may hand it off to a coder someday to scale it up from prototype to production, but at least he can understand whats going on.

The context only has to live in the doctors head now. So theres no wasted time from communication and speccing.
