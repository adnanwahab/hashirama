Adnan thought maybe it was 100% his fault. Adnan has a tendency to self blame and put intense pressure on himself to be perfect make things work flawlessly. But then, adnan had consulted with a few different experts and psychologists and was told that this was in fact, not right. And that something actually happened between April 5 and June 5. And that is what we are going to be discussing. No matter how long it takes, we will discover the truth. It will not reutnr things to how they were before. But, it will set a new precedent in the law. So that people don't consipire behind others back.
