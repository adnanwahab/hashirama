Why write in an AI era when LLMs can output 70 words per minute and its gifted college-student as of mid 2024 ?


Writng improves thinking.


Why does thinking matter?


<!-- well actually, society doesnt seem to reward good thinking much.-->

people said similar shit about writing when google was invented - link source


paul graham was a regular joe coder.

Then he made a company and got lucky and sold it during the dot com boom.


But he made to retire and then he could think for fun.



Then he wrote like 100 essays, and they were pretty good, actually probably one of the reasons i went into software.


As a kid i wanted to be a writer, mostly because i watnd to just make cool stuff.


I loved video games mostly, but books were my 2nd favorite hooby.


I usually didn't go to class, i just went ot lbirary and solved puzzles, or read gutenberg bible, or playd chess against myself.

But when i turned 16, i thoguht, maybe i sohuld do somrthing like pragmatic.

Because most writiers i loved were about 40ish when they wrote their best work.


IT seemed to me, that writing-skill was not a function of time spent writing.


The level of writing - is basically the level of thinking.


Paul graham's writing was among the best in the world, because he basically trained his mind painting pictures, studying arts, and then trying programming as a hobby.



And the code he wrote wasnt just A->B. It wasn't necessarily pragmatic or "software engineering at all". IT was art.




Back in the dot com - man i almost was, html coders got paid $50 bucks an hour. Html is just writing data - its easy as hell.





Paul graham's invention was using some bizzare odd combination of LISP to write macros, which are considered bad practice, because they are Complex.


Smart people use compelx tools, to their own coutner producivty

Reddit lisp because they liked paul graham. And they had to rewrite in python- because Open SOurce libraires created by millions volunteers just beat anything a lisp can create. Because lisp is just weird greek shit. I read SICP, it was my password for 20 years.


But basically, its not practicaly.


Javascript, python, golang, etc are PRactical. They are simple. It's hard to injure your brain using them.






Also - Link to morpheus - There's an idea that AI could read everyones blog.


Imagine had a blog, with all their expertise - Neil Gaiman Secret Worlds - hashirama - eats your worlds and shits unvierses - guren alagan n-  link anime - deocrtaete easily



This blog is not english - it is actually a semantic - latent represtation of shit - and then blah



If everyone had a blog -how would that work ? how many other blogs oculd you read? VIf you spent all day, your could read like 100 max. That means no one would really understand anyone -- just too much INFO man - link to alan kays's cognitivie basies e




BUT GPUs can easily crunch Text into numbers - and those numbers are a representaiton - bret victor -representation matters


The Embeedding = the "meaning" or "truthiness" fo your words


so GPus can crunch -

7 billion blog posts per day.

Each post has 500 words  = 500 tokens.


864,000blog posts/GPU/day
7,000,000,000blog posts/day   ≈8,102GPUs


1 GPU - 4090 costs $1500 - $1500 * 8000 = $32,720,000

For 32 million dollars, the government or some company could easily - Read an elaborate vote


Vote = what should our planet do? what should our nation do? Not just - which actor do we want in ofice? trumpt or reagan or whoever?


Politicains are basically actors. Thats what they have to be - charisma - pg



But using this method - people could vote, not on "People" but on issues.

And they could say why they think that - which is fucking improatnt


-- link emial



without evidence + reasoning = your vote = just opinon

opinons are cool, but evidence based reasoning is more effective ask any company or universety.



Imagine if the whole world was governed by logic, reason, data, and basically Truth, not emotions, and bias, and basically dicatrors.


That would be a eutopia, imo.



Why dont people care about issues or the world or real shit? They watch the news as a spectator - but you can create news - alan kay said "new not news" - alan kay -

I wonrederd that all my life.


Von NEumann said - "" - Sorry DR, i disagree.


Thats not human nature - thats just the situation and the context.



In a better world - everyone would (invert kirshmanurthi)

figt club - and buddhism said - youre not your job your not your sofa oyrunot your brekaups or dramas or ego or anyting.


But whats next? blowing up a bank wont cause - permanent change - it will subsitate one set of problems for a new one .



how to actually - over come that??? real progress doesnt come from incremtnal progers-  structuure revolaution
