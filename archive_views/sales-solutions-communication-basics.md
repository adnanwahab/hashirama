# Everything you need to know about Enterprise Sales and Advanced Communication

"Sales is everything. A founder has to sell to everyone. To recruit (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj0hpsJvrko) their employees, their customers, investors, god help you, even your wife." - Marc Andressen (https://a16z.com/why-must-you-pay-sales-people-commissions/)

# Fundamentals and Theory

Leave nothing out. No knowledge is wasted.

If you disagree with something, find the counter-point, the refutation

Marduk, the ancient god of the first human civilization of babylonia had 3 powers:
1. Observation - he saw
2. Speech - magic words to slay the dragon of chaos

The birth of truth often begins with contradiction.

Knowledge is all incomplete. It is only training wheels.

The road to epiphany is the road to ultimate victory. (https://www.amazon.com/Maps-Meaning-Architecture-Jordan-Peterson/dp/0415922224)

JBP said the hierarchy is older than life itself. We instinctively look for leadership. It is biological.

Does good beat evil?  (https://paulgraham.com/good.html)of course, a good person has more friends.

The human at the top of the hierarchy is usually the one with most connections, or better ones.

You can gain power 2 ways:
1. Be liked by billlions.
2. Be loved by thousands.

The best connections form by compassion, and competence. Physiolgically these traits are incentivized by serrotonin.

# Peter Thiel - https://blakemasters.tumblr.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup

Thiel is prety coo

His sales method, in a nutshel, was not to persuade.

But to ask questions, and understand.

Not to bring understanding, but to create it in the moment.

This was good at convincing, because the other side could feel that they were not being manipulated

Dawkins thought all communication was manipulation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKOj5x-PqPs)

Geoffrey Hinton, creator of the Transformer:

https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/lecture_notes.shtml

I don't think so.

Is knowledge false? are words empty? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81)

Western civilziation says emptiness is bad (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81)

# John Doerr -  (https://www.whatmatters.com/)Sillicon Valley would not exist without intel. Intel would not exist without John Doerr.

# Why great companies fail

They did not make something people want.

They did not listen to their customers.

Their sales process was not discovery.

Perhaps it was merely perception maangemnt

The best sales proceses are often open ended.

Meaning both sides learn cool shit

If you listen to your customers, they can tell the future

If you don't, you'll end up like Intel, Observable (https://observablehq.com/@adnanwahab?tab=recents), Sun Microsystems or Sillicon Graphics, etc.

Good Founders must lead in all areas.
If you want to hire a good sales engineer, designer, HR, or Scientist,

You must first learn sales and design and people management.

That way, you know how to identify talent.

That's why i'm so good at picking which girl will be compatible with me.

Because i used to be one.

# Is percpetion maangement bad?

It's merely the wrong focus.

If you care too much what people think, you are shackled to chaos

If you care too little, you are fighting a system bigger than you

You find this happening again and again; good scientists will fight the system rather than learn to work with the system and take advantage of all the system has to offer. It has a lot, if you learn how to use it. It takes patience, but you can learn how to use the system pretty well, and you can learn how to get around it. After all, if you want a decision `No', you just go to your boss and get a `No' easy. If you want to do something, don't ask, do it. Present him with an accomplished fact. Don't give him a chance to tell you `No'. But if you want a `No', it's easy to get a \`No'.

Another personality defect is ego assertion and I'll speak in this case of my own experience. I came from Los Alamos and in the early days I was using a machine in New York at 590 Madison Avenue where we merely rented time. I was still dressing in western clothes, big slash pockets, a bolo and all those things. I vaguely noticed that I was not getting as good service as other people. So I set out to measure. You came in and you waited for your turn; I felt I was not getting a fair deal. I said to myself, "Why? No Vice President at IBM said, \`Give Hamming a bad time'. It is the secretaries at the bottom who are doing this. When a slot appears, they'll rush to find someone to slip in, but they go out and find somebody else. Now, why? I haven't mistreated them." Answer: I wasn't dressing the way they felt somebody in that situation should. It came down to just that — I wasn't dressing properly. I had to make the decision — was I going to assert my ego and dress the way I wanted to and have it steadily drain my effort from my professional life, or was I going to appear to conform better? I decided I would make an effort to appear to conform properly. The moment I did, I got much better service. And now, as an old colorful character, I get better service than other people.

You should dress according to the expectations of the audience spoken to. If I am going to give an address at the MIT computer center, I dress with a bolo and an old corduroy jacket or something else. I know enough not to let my clothes, my appearance, my manners get in the way of what I care about. An enormous number of scientists feel they must assert their ego and do their thing their way. They have got to be able to do this, that, or the other thing, and they pay a steady price.

John Tukey almost always dressed very casually. He would go into an important office and it would take a long time before the other fellow realized that this is a first-class man and he had better listen. For a long time John has had to overcome this kind of hostility. It's wasted effort! I didn't say you should conform; I said "The appearance of conforming gets you a long way." If you chose to assert your ego in any number of ways, "I am going to do it my way," you pay a small steady price throughout the whole of your professional career. And this, over a whole lifetime, adds up to an enormous amount of needless trouble.

By taking the trouble to tell jokes to the secretaries and being a little friendly, I got superb secretarial help. For instance, one time for some idiot reason all the reproducing services at Murray Hill were tied up. Don't ask me how, but they were. I wanted something done. My secretary called up somebody at Holmdel, hopped the company car, made the hour-long trip down and got it reproduced, and then came back. It was a payoff for the times I had made an effort to cheer her up, tell her jokes and be friendly; it was that little extra work that later paid off for me. By realizing you have to use the system and studying how to get the system to do your work, you learn how to adapt the system to your desires. Or you can fight it steadily, as a small undeclared war, for the whole of your life.

And I think John Tukey paid a terrible price needlessly. He was a genius anyhow, but I think it would have been far better, and far simpler, had he been willing to conform a little bit instead of ego asserting. He is going to dress the way he wants all of the time. It applies not only to dress but to a thousand other things; people will continue to fight the system. Not that you shouldn't occasionally!

When they moved the library from the middle of Murray Hill to the far end, a friend of mine put in a request for a bicycle. Well, the organization was not dumb. They waited awhile and sent back a map of the grounds saying, "Will you please indicate on this map what paths you are going to take so we can get an insurance policy covering you." A few more weeks went by. They then asked, "Where are you going to store the bicycle and how will it be locked so we can do so and so." He finally realized that of course he was going to be red-taped to death so he gave in. He rose to be the President of Bell Laboratories.

Barney Oliver was a good man. He wrote a letter one time to the IEEE. At that time the official shelf space at Bell Labs was so much and the height of the IEEE Proceedings at that time was larger; and since you couldn't change the size of the official shelf space he wrote this letter to the IEEE Publication person saying, since so many IEEE members were at Bell Labs and since the official space was so high the journal size should be changed. He sent it for his boss's signature. Back came a carbon with his signature, but he still doesn't know whether the original was sent or not. I am not saying you shouldn't make gestures of reform. I am saying that my study of able people is that they don't get themselves committed to that kind of warfare. They play it a little bit and drop it and get on with their work.

Many a second-rate fellow gets caught up in some little twitting of the system, and carries it through to warfare. He expends his energy in a foolish project. Now you are going to tell me that somebody has to change the system. I agree; somebody's has to. Which do you want to be? The person who changes the system or the person who does first-class science? Which person is it that you want to be? Be clear, when you fight the system and struggle with it, what you are doing, how far to go out of amusement, and how much to waste your effort fighting the system. My advice is to let somebody else do it and you get on with becoming a first-class scientist. Very few of you have the ability to both reform the system and become a first-class scientist.

On the other hand, we can't always give in. There are times when a certain amount of rebellion is sensible. I have observed almost all scientists enjoy a certain amount of twitting the system for the sheer love of it. What it comes down to basically is that you cannot be original in one area without having originality in others. Originality is being different. You can't be an original scientist without having some other original characteristics. But many a scientist has let his quirks in other places make him pay a far higher price than is necessary for the ego satisfaction he or she gets. I'm not against all ego assertion; I'm against some.

Another fault is anger. Often a scientist becomes angry, and this is no way to handle things. Amusement, yes, anger, no. Anger is misdirected. You should follow and cooperate rather than struggle against the system all the time.

Another thing you should look for is the positive side of things instead of the negative. I have already given you several examples, and there are many, many more; how, given the situation, by changing the way I looked at it, I converted what was apparently a defect to an asset. I'll give you another example. I am an egotistical person; there is no doubt about it. I knew that most people who took a sabbatical to write a book, didn't finish it on time. So before I left, I told all my friends that when I come back, that book was going to be done! Yes, I would have it done — I'd have been ashamed to come back without it! I used my ego to make myself behave the way I wanted to. I bragged about something so I'd have to perform. I found out many times, like a cornered rat in a real trap, I was surprisingly capable. I have found that it paid to say, \`\`Oh yes, I'll get the answer for you Tuesday,'' not having any idea how to do it. By Sunday night I was really hard thinking on how I was going to deliver by Tuesday. I often put my pride on the line and sometimes I failed, but as I said, like a cornered rat I'm surprised how often I did a good job. I think you need to learn to use yourself. I think you need to know how to convert a situation from one view to another which would increase the chance of success.

Now self-delusion in humans is very, very common. There are innumerable ways of you changing a thing and kidding yourself and making it look some other way. When you ask, "Why didn't you do such and such," the person has a thousand alibis. If you look at the history of science, usually these days there are ten people right there ready, and we pay off for the person who is there first. The other nine fellows say, "Well, I had the idea but I didn't do it and so on and so on." There are so many alibis. Why weren't you first? Why didn't you do it right? Don't try an alibi. Don't try and kid yourself. You can tell other people all the alibis you want. I don't mind. But to yourself try to be honest.

If you really want to be a first-class scientist you need to know yourself, your weaknesses, your strengths, and your bad faults, like my egotism. How can you convert a fault to an asset? How can you convert a situation where you haven't got enough manpower to move into a direction when that's exactly what you need to do? I say again that I have seen, as I studied the history, the successful scientist changed the viewpoint and what was a defect became an asset.

In summary, I claim that some of the reasons why so many people who have greatness within their grasp don't succeed are: they don't work on important problems, they don't become emotionally involved, they don't try and change what is difficult to some other situation which is easily done but is still important, and they keep giving themselves alibis why they don't. They keep saying that it is a matter of luck. I've told you how easy it is; furthermore I've told you how to reform. Therefore, go forth and become great scientists!

**a voice**

that captures human minds

a private discourse

to become a leader of men

is to become a leader of their minds

**for the men that will ultimately follow**

you

are those that first follow their own

master

make their master a follower

and the man will come

of his own accord

that master

is the mind

in order to teach other worldly things

the sincerity of a student must be

equally otherworldly

the desire to abandon

must be as great

as a desire to know

it will never be a coincidence that

those who have arrived at the grand

of their professions

are the most appropriate individuals for

this journey

for such things come

to those who have uncommon in

who have even a loose prayer

of imbibing the holy antithetical and

almost unbelievable ideas that are at

the center of the truth

a man who truly believes that the sun

rotates around the earth

and who has not the dna or the courage

to seriously entertain the possibility

that almost all that he has learned

about life and the mind is criminally

incorrect

is not a candidate for the truth

no matter how sincere this letter may be

or how much he is willing to pay for it

all humans default

[Music]

if you seek to be heard

or listened to

or to influence

whether it is your employees

your spouse

your followers your fans

or your very own children

you must cultivate a voice that

resonates

in what way

do such things happen

the vocal cords are forced open by air

rising from the lungs

the lungs are filled with air that we

breathe from the outside

but the air is saturated

by life force

prana

pranayama

is not the act of modulating breathing

as is widely believed

it is the act of modulating prana

i will share with you

a siddha secret

the amount of prana that one inhales

is inversely proportional

to the amount of involuntary thought

that is occurring

as he inhales

the lesser one's capacity for curbing

involuntary thought

the less prana he imbibes from the air

the greater one's capacity

for curbing involuntary thought

the more prana he imbibes from the air

unless i forget

to drop this bomb upon you

mindfulness

actually increases

involuntary thought

it is among the greatest myths

propagated

in this prescription oriented society in

which we live

we can thus deduce that the man who

thinks only when he desires to think

will intake more prana

and thus he will have a far greater

constitution

this actually causes the vocal cords to

resonate

at a different frequency

this difference in frequency

has a particular effect

upon the mind which hears it

it must be understood

that we are not the in control humans

that we believe ourselves to be

we are products of our varying

physiologies

and slaves to our minds

until we learn to conquer this mind

next it is the content of our speech

that has an effect upon human beings

it must first be understood that this

content cannot be instructed or

prescribed

if a psychologist teacher or guru tells

you what to say

it will do very little

cosmetics is the order of the day in

this society

and cosmetics have zero power

to sway the human mind

if you speak the words that you are told

to speak

the mind that hears these words will see

right through them

it will detect their lack of resonance

and character

understand this

a man who speaks words

that are a byproduct

of having truly arrived somewhere

within himself

carries a resonance and a power

that overpowers all minds

[Music]

humans listen and follow

that which their mind verifies as truth

humans that learn and cultivate these

truths

do not lead people astray

for it is not in their constitution to

do so

the beautiful irony in it all is that

humans actually yearn to be led

not toward the things that they desire

but towards a place

that will satiate them so completely

that they become free

from the imprisonment of desires

How did luffy beat Katakuri?

Luffy was rubber, but mochi is stronger, faster, more malleable, adaptable, more experienced and could see into the future perfectly.

Luffy had authenticity. He wasn't trying to be someone else. He was himself.

Katakuri (https://gist.githubusercontent.com/adnanwahab/a51ebf1f28172ec4306fd5a61bd3bcc3/raw/8222a1a931f26b90c7c3e00666d0461959693b86/gistfile1.txt) had an ego wound. When he was a child, he was bullied.

When he got stronger, he beat up the bullies.

But then the bullies attacked his sister. And Katakuri couldn't allow that.

So he put up a front, of being an invincible super human.

He concealed his goofy teeth, and love for dougnuts.

He thought, by using fear, people would respect him.

But when he fights luffy, t

Luffy wins with one thing, against someone better in every way.

Luffy does not stay down, like David Goggins.

With that one thing, he conquered everything.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3C3M0HJAjs

Later, it is revealed that katakuri could have stood up.

But, this conflict has spiritual signifance to him.

In his life, he was undefeated, an invincible superhuman.

But he learned something from luffy

That is why he let him self surrender.

# But seeing the future is not enough.

# Sometimes, we need more than conviction.

# The will to sacrifice and abandon everything we used to know.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psVjt8wu8GM

Suzaku was an idealist. But as a kid, his father was Prime minister, and started a war.

Suzaku wanted to end the war, so he stabbed his father.

The guilt from this made him grow up too fast.

As a young adult, he enlisted into the army, hoping to change the system from the inside.

He rises through the ranks fast. But he has something like a deathwish.

He's reckless beyond logic.

Suzaku doesn't value his own life, due to guilt.

That is his strength, and limitation.

Deep down, Suzaku maybe even wants to die, because self-sacrifice is some form of penance to him.

If he dies in combat, maybe he can forgive himself.

With sacrifice, maybe he can atone.

So his child-friend uses mind-control and commands him to "Live"

This contradiction went against every fiber of his being

And from that paradox, he went beyond all human possibility

"The punishment for what you have done shall be this then: you will live on serving as a Knight of Faith. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_of_faith#:~:text=The%20knight%20of%20faith%20(Danish,and%20independently%20from%20the%20world.) **You will no longer live your life as Suzaku Kururugi, you shall sacrifice the ordinary pleasures of your life in benefit of the world for eternity."**

Is the will to live stronger than anything?

Is it a contradiction? since we know we will not be here forever?

Is it because all life begins with love?
is that why Voldemort burned when he touched harry potter?

Who can know the details of your life better than you?

Every situation has a truth.

The truth is that which has predictive power.

This truth of your mind, and your life cannot be realized by anyone but you.

The purpose of a teacher is to spark curiosity, not explain.
The greatest astronomy was taught by sagan, who had questions (https://kiriakakis.net/comics/mused/a-day-at-the-park), not answers (https://www.paulgraham.com/getideas.html?viewfullsite=1).

Books and Teachers can help you at the beginner level.
But at the medium or advanced level, one must begin to carve their own path into the unknown.

Siddharha studied with the world's best for 7 years.

But then, he had to abandon his teachers and go into the unknown.

Siddhartha could not accept the world.

So he resolved to find a solution at all costs.

That is how he became a Buddah.

And because he did that, the world finally began to change.

A teacher must have courage.

Because to teach is to give away cool knowledge that you hope is helpful.
