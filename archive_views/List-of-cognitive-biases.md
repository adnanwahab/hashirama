List of cognitive biases

Bias arises from various processes that are sometimes difficult to distinguish. These include:

Bounded rationality — limits on optimization and rationality
Prospect theory
Evolutionary psychology — Remnants from evolutionary adaptive mental functions.[57]
Mental accounting
Adaptive bias — basing decisions on limited information and biasing them based on the costs of being wrong
Attribute substitution — making a complex, difficult judgment by unconsciously replacing it with an easier judgment[58]
Attribution theory
Salience
Naïve realism
Cognitive dissonance, and related:
Impression management
Self-perception theory
Information-processing shortcuts (heuristics),[59] including:
Availability heuristic — estimating what is more likely by what is more available in memory, which is biased toward vivid, unusual, or emotionally charged examples[6]
Representativeness heuristic — judging probabilities based on resemblance[6]
Affect heuristic — basing a decision on an emotional reaction rather than a calculation of risks and benefits[60]
Emotional and moral motivations[61] deriving, for example, from:
The two-factor theory of emotion
The somatic markers hypothesis
Introspection illusion
Misinterpretations or misuse of statistics; innumeracy.
Social influence[62]
The brain's limited information processing capacity[63]
Noisy information processing (distortions during storage in and retrieval from memory).[64] For example, a 2012 Psychological Bulletin article suggests that at least eight seemingly unrelated biases can be produced by the same information-theoretic generative mechanism.[64] The article shows that noisy deviations in the memory-based information processes that convert objective evidence (observations) into subjective estimates (decisions) can produce regressive conservatism, the belief revision (Bayesian conservatism), illusory correlations, illusory superiority (better-than-average effect) and worse-than-average effect, subadditivity effect, exaggerated expectation, overconfidence, and the hard–easy effect.
