# The beauty of the Consitution

was that it can be changed.

The founding fathers were great dudes.

And what really made them great is that they knew they didnt know shit.

So they left it open to their successors to remix and redefine the rules as we see fit.

Unfortunately, due to lobbyists and general greed and myopia, the current aristoraccy has squandered that gift.

They have entrenched the status quo in layer up on layer of over 60,000 pages of arcane laws, regulations, and byzantine regulations.


# Constitution of the Future

"Visualization leverages the human visual system to augment human intellect: we can use it to better understand these important abstract processes, and perhaps other things, too." - Mike Bostock

Visualization helps people to debug complex systems. It makes it easier to understand the behavior of a system.
It makes it accessible, easier and fun. You can instantly know the value of any variable in your program.

All society has, is superfical half truths, derived from incomplete info.

Knowledge is like training wheels.
You must learn what is good, the best of what humans have made.
and then you must carve your own way.
That is how progress is made.

And progress is the only thing that will be rewarded
in a society that automates everything.

progress means, to push the corpus of human knowledge forward

RMS please read dis. you were my hero.
because of you said "i want to make things so amazing i didn't even believe they were possible."
And i had just watched gurren lagann, and kamina said "we'll kick reason to the curb and go beyond the impossible"
So all my life i tried to do that. Sometimes i took easy problems and made them impossible.

What if everyone wrote a blog on earth?
Why do that?

First it honors everyone you ever met.
When two people meet, and ideas are exchanged, and they develop those ideas while apart.
That is the best of humanity.
Naval says "networking is entertainment"
If blogging or journaling daily was common practice, there would be no newtorking.
Only friendship.
and we would gain friends new friends, who resonated with the things we care about the most.
Which are sometimes, the things we do not yet have the words to articulate at the time.

Misunderstandings would lessen

Do we really need social networks anymore???
I think they were just training wheels.

I think it would be better if everyone made their own home, with their own hands.

And then we could visit each others secret worlds, and then people would begin to understand
the infinite depths of a human bean
and the infinite sky, beyond the ceiling they thought was the limit

"secret worlds " - neil gaiman

No i dont mean "everyone is hypnotized by group think"
i think everyone is actually really smart. but also really lazy.
And thats okay. My ability never caught up to my taste, until last year.

So i never made anything that was really mine. I started, but never finished.

We can make helios the AI for real in like 5 years.
By 2030, 100% of people will escape poverty, and will have some internet access.

Rather than people reading the news, they could create ideas that are new.

And together, we could plan how they will be done.

I've been thinking about that for 10 years.
