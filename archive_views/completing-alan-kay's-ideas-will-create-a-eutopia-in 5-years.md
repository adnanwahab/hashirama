#+title: The Glory Of Alan Kay

Alan kay is probably one of the top 5 smartest people to walk the earth.

I wasn't there at xerox, i don't know how important he was. But it seems like he was at least as important as any CEO to any company out there.

Alan's story is that he read 20,000 books. When i heard that, i started to read 1 book a day in about 3 hours and take notes.

When he got to school, it was just for fun. they couldnt teach him anything.

    Alan is credited with inventing or "directing" the invention of

1. the modern inernet and LAN
2. the modern GUI - only like 1 % of the population uses a terminal or text-only UIs
3. OOPs , which many FP nerds will say stinks but basically is responsbile for the modern culture of libraries, and open source
4. the mouse
5. ipad
6. probably a bunch of shit that DARPA will never publicly release

the story is that he cretaed the gui to mimic the real world

specifically the idea of object constancy after reading piaget's work

basically he thought, if you can make a computer intuitive for a child, then everyone would want to use it.

which means, he expanded the market 100x

and since the value of the netowrk is euqal to the square of its size - he basically created like 50 trillion in market cap

by comparison, saudi aramco is the most valuable company in the world - but they are only 1/10th as big.

Saudi Aramco was made from 250 million years of dinosaurs fermenting for about 50 million years.

so one guy and his friends made about 10x more money than 300 million years of global energy compressed into a single company
thats nuts man
that is nuts

in 1970, the world market cap was 20 trillion.
in 2021, it was about 130 trillion.

if the computer created like 110 trillion in market cap, i would say alan kay and xerox parc are rougly responsible for half of that.
so alan, by himself and a few friends made 60 trillion in value. While capturing none for themselves. Thats nuts man

alan kay is the only guy that steve jobs and bill gates would look up to and quote in powerpoints

buts hes largely unheard of today

I honestly have no idea why.

My education began when i saw his ted talk, and it finished when i read all his work.

Almost everything else in the world was like chicken scratch.

people are not born equal
we each take shape differently
which leads us to care about others
its because your mind and body are unlike any one else
that we we're drawn to others
in search of common ground

My dreams became true, thanks to you.

I met alan kay, bret victor, greg brockman, mike bostock,
I met bill nye the science guy twice - at barnes and nobles and at a music festival
I also met the chainsmokers and steve aoki and skrillex

I completed my research

now my dream is to become a vessel for the hopes of the forsaken, the lost, the broken, the weak.
my dream is to make all their dreams come true.
Until there is no difference between what we can imagine and what we see.
Until the boundaries between fatasnsy, science-fiction
until the idea of tragedy is nothing a memory.

i dont think ill ever take a wife, because most woman would want to raise a child or they would get bored.

and i dont think i want ot have children because im scared of affecting them negatively.

I might adopt when im 60-70. or make clones or synthetic life.

Alan Kay had two protoges after xerox parc

1. sam altman who people already know.
2. Bret Victor who doesn't get the same amount of attention

Alan Kay - 2019

Many of what we consider our “immense challenges” have come about from our genetic heritage of
hundreds of thousands of years of coping at small scales, projecting our beliefs on our perceptions,
etc. These have made it difficult for us to imagine the consequences of the new powers brought by
the extremely recent inventions of modern engineering, science, the industrial revolution, and
progress itself.

What is going on? The key is that we don’t actually see what’s out there. We just think we do. This
illusion is called “size constancy” and it is another one of the almost 200 known cognitive biases. The
problem is that we “know and believe” that the two poker chips are the same size, and we humans
unfortunately mentally project our beliefs out on the world to help us “see” at all. Marshall McLuhan’s
great line for this is:

“Until I believe it, I can’t see it!”

The key point here is that 56 years after the first clear warnings, the general public, their
governments, their industries, etc., still cannot summon enough informed imagination to see this as an
approaching global disaster on many fronts. This set of ostriches embodies all of the Six Core Biases,
and many more.

Our planet is being poked by the finger of human blindness, and is wobbling. If the climate topples
along the known dimensions (and more that are just starting to manifest), it is likely that human power
will not be able to put Humpty-Dumpty back together again. The key— as in possible epidemics, flood
control, etc.—is to be able to vividly imagine the disaster well enough ahead of time to keep the
finger from being able to topple.

A dam broke in India and swept this car away. The man jumped in and saved the woman inside while
he was in great danger of having the car toppling over on him. This is our species at its best. But the
reason the dam broke was that the society could not imagine the broken dam well enough to “fix the
dam before it broke”. This is perfectly typical human behavior, but it is not at all reasonable in this day
and age.

No one and no committee knows enough to lay out all the direct problem solving actions that are
needed to deal with “immense challenges”. But past history of dealing successfully with a number of
such challenges shows that processes involving many thousands of people can be organized well
enough to yield enormous synergies of effort and produce new ways to understand the challenges
and invent and build new ways to handle them. Like a vast epidemic (which will be one of the
upcoming immense challenges) much needs to be done beforehand, in the immediate present, and
longterm in the future, including training the next generations of problem finders, solvers—and—
problem avoiders.

The kwisatz haderach was a cool idea.

My dream, is to edit this blog, until 100% of people feel compelled to drink the water of life.

I believe, the golden road, or the rainbow road, a galaxy that is optimal will occur in 5 years.

When everyone becomes the enlightened one. When everyone shares responsibility for the world.

When everyone leads themself.

When everyone is the protagonist, of a different kind of story.

I believe, if god exists, it is the integral of all known perspectives.

A perfect society, simply means that everyone is happy, healthy, and safe.

A Eutopia, simply means, that everyone is lucid, intelligent and emotionally sound.

When everyone agrees the world is good enough.

Until there are 8 billion Buddahs, we will not rest.

Our civilization is baby, barely 1000 years old.

We are only fingernails. But when all countries, all institutions, all peoples hearts and minds are aligned.

The child will grow up.

Buddah knew he could not change the world.

So he changed himself. And because he did, the world finally began to change.

I could not change myself. But I can <a href="https://youtu.be/xH0wMhlm-b8?si=XDRk197trjQ0cPaq&t=134">change human nature</a> and Then every human will change the world together.

Hopefully by writing a blag.

So that synthetic intellect may know the heart and mind of everyone in the world.

And then, a plan of action can be constructed instantly.

Then, the government's role will be to imbue, and empower, and to restore anew.

No individual can change the world alone. A human by themself, can do nothing.

But together, humanity cannot be stopped by entropy, or meteors, or the gods themselves.

In a sense, Alan Kay gave me everything I ever Had

The world seemed kinda nonsenical. I didn't know what I wanted to do.

I learned about Paul Graham when I was 15. Before That I didn't know what I wanted to do.

I had modded video games using Lua, perhaps obsessivly. But i didnt think it would be useful or anything.

I thought, what do i love most? Books and Video Games probably.

I had beaten most video games and they seemed to be the same.

Should i write books? Books don't really matter though. and i looked up online that all of the best writers i knew were in their 40s when they did good work.

So I'd have to do something from 18-40...

In RPGs, i learned that the skill you choose can kind of define how easy the game is.

Some skills are game-breakingly broken. Like resto druids in season 2.

Well I like winning, and so i guess i should try being a resto druid.

And Druids weren't good at 5v5. So programming might pigeonhole me to not let me do stuff i wanted.

Obviously you can win with other specs, its just slightly more difficult. Some like Warriors or DeathKnights were just as broken.

I loved anime, so i wanted to find the most advanced or funny anime theory.

Then i found 4chan. Then 4channers hated reddit, so i tried reddit.

So i looked up who porgrammed reddit, and 4chan.

and i liked how they thoghut.

and then i found paul graham from the people who made reddit.

and it was some of the best writing i ever heard.

So i went to hacker news. and the people seemed pretty funny.

so i looked up shit that they liked.

And found MIT OCW and SICP and EMACS and UBUNTU

I wasted a LOT of time customizing emacs and UBUNUT. jesus god.

anyway i got to chapter 4 of SICP and it was aMAZING.
I Loved MAGIC and how they thought of programs as spells and incantions.

For a 20 years, i thought writing could not change the world.

But, how do you explain the bible, torah and quran?

Writing is thought made visible. The best writing is just a good thinker who spent the time editing. That's it. No mystery here.

What makes a good thinker? Devotion to truth, or humor.

Isn't everyone capable of that? of course motherfucker.

Language is flawed.

Language can hurt us.

There was a year when i didnt want to speak or write anything.

But langauge will change. I'm sure chomsky or a friend will know.

Can thinking change the world? Well, what else does?

Everything that is good in the world, came from books, or was imagined in the heart of a dreamer.

We are 99.8% similar to chimpanzees.

Chimpanzees can only form groups of up to 150.

150 is dunbar's number, or the number of peopel you can be connected to at any given time.

Esentially the number of consicousnes you can be aware of. if everyone was connected to a web of 150 people in a structured way. maybe one for research, one for fun, etc. then humans would be self organizing and would need little else

Human beans only started to form groups when language was invented around 100,000 years ago.

2000 years ago, the world had only 200 people. Roughly the population of bangladesh. Not long ago, one country was the whole world.

So i was hooked.

I guess Alan Kay and Paul Graham were the reasons i moved to San francisco.

I tried a coding school for a bit with shawn, tony and mracus. Everyone was cool, but i had 0 people skills and kinda just self isolated .

Tbh, i think video game culture made me a little "toxic"?

Anyawy, I started working at a company that got acquired by square

But i didn't really do very well at any job until I got to zoox. Zoox offered free therapy, so i tried it and was able to identify and drop some stuff.

Also went to vipassana retreat and listened to goenka on repeat for hours.

Thats it.

If i am correct, Anduril will pivot to industrial, medical, and other robots.
