# goal - Build many dynamicland.org

## Why? Because dynamicland.org is the coolest thing ever invented

## How? - Fool-proof, safe, reliable, and easy-to-use robotics UI

## we can put a dynamicland in every home by 2030

## Modules

## 1. Hardware Design + Repair

## 2. Perception

## 3. Planing + Predciton

## 4. Simulation + UI + Real World Applications

Alan Kay met with openai around 2016
Alan Kay talked about one other individual [Bret Victor](https://worrydream.com).
4. Bret's work has won the Apple Design Award twice.
5. Bret victor basically said, everything he did before  2014 was past even i thought it was futuristic.
7. But Bret Victor's newest creation - DynamicLand - is better than anything the world has seen. - Computers are a prison for our minds... compared to the DynamicLand.
8. DynamicLand = really cool
9. Build  many Dynamiclands = good idea.

Alan kay asked <a href="https://internetat50.com/references/Kay_How.pdf">HOW?</a>.

> In the Spring of 2016, VPRI joined as part of Y Combinator Research's (YCR) HARC -- Human Advancement Research Community. HARC was founded based on conversations between Alan Kay and Sam Altman of  ycr.org   -----  http://www.vpri.org/ - https://web.archive.org/web/20170914174755/https://harc.ycr.org/

the whole worlds is video game - like owrld of warcraft
when you beat wow - you basically jsut sit around in orgirammer, chat with guild mates - sometimes do raids
real life = video game you deisng togeher tho be win/win which mean everyone wins - team-based cooperative- reality-creation MMO of your design
and this repo just the LUA-based llm customzation layer for robotics - thats the new gme of 2025
# 5pm new blog post - economics of llm paralllelization - used this to improve 20 rrepos - today - for jp
# 5pm new blog post - gen course content in observable - 64 demos - explorable explanintions (take existing best in class demos - redblob, happydream, figma-guy , 3js journey - add sliders to any variable) - for arthur.botparty
