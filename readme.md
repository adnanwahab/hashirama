# Robotics-Odyssey.com

## goal - Build many dynamicland.org

## Why? Because dynamicland.org is the coolest thing ever invented

## How? - Fool-proof, safe, reliable, and easy-to-use robotics UI

## we can put a dynamicland in every home by 2030

# Modules for info-course

## 1. Hardware Design + Repair

## 2. Perception

## 3. Planing + Predciton

## 4. Simulation + UI + Real World Applications

Alan kay asked <a href="https://internetat50.com/references/Kay_How.pdf">HOW?</a>.



OpeAI was born when Alan Kay met with YCResearch around 2016.
Alan Kay called sam Altman "the builder of a new civilization"
Alan Kay talked about one other individual [Bret Victor](https://worrydream.com).
4. Bret's work has won the Apple Design Award twice.
5. Bret victor basically said, everything he did before  2014 was past even i thought it was futuristic.
7. But Bret Victor's newest creation - DynamicLand - is better than anything the world has seen

> In the Spring of 2016, VPRI joined as part of Y Combinator Research's (YCR) HARC -- Human Advancement Research Community.
> HARC was founded based on conversations between Alan Kay and Sam Altman of  ycr.org   -----  http://www.vpri.org/

This repo contains everything you need to build a unicorn robotics startup. ([shipfast](https://shipfa.st/) for robotics)
1. A react app for MMO-tele-operation + admin for ops, safety, understanding theory->practice.
2. A (react-native+livekit) app to code agents using on-device llm to gen correct prompts to auto-write infra+anything you want.
3. A deno server for server-side simulation, webgpu, and unity,unreal, nvidia omniverse integrations.
4. [sqlite+litestream for db](https://youtu.be/RqubKSF3wig?si=M6okGXrR_pyKB-8J) - + tailscale for connectivity + starlink for 5g in hard to reach places.
5. extra embedding infra for jetson-container-> $500 semi-autuonomous rosie for feeding cats.
