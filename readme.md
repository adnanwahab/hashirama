# Robotics-Odyssey.com - goal= Build lots dynamicland.org

# Why?? dynamicland.org = the coolest thing ever

## 2gether we will put a dynamicland in every home by 2030 Modules for info-course -  Fool-proof  robotics 4 feeding stray cats -> clean your room + build robotic art!!

## 1. Hardware Design + Repair

## 2. Perception + a little cgi

## 3. Planing + Predciton

## 4. Simulation + UI + Real World Applications

# 1. ALan kay + his 25 friends created 60 Trillion in USD in 5 years - thats more than saudi aramco and 250 million years of dino saur fermentation using their mind!
# 2. Alan kay asked <a href="https://internetat50.com/references/Kay_How.pdf">HOW?</a>.
# 3. OpeAI was made when Alan Kay met with YCResearch around 2016.
# 4. Alan Kay said sam Altman = "the builder of a new civilization"
# 5. Alan Kay spoke highly about one other individual [Bret Victor](https://worrydream.com).
# 4. Bret's won the Apple Design Award twice.
# 5. Bret victor basically said, everything he did b4 2014 was complete
# 7. Bret's  newest creation - DynamicLand - is better than anything
# 8. bret said - programming = just thinking. writing = just thinking. anyone can do it. the best thinking is usually done in pictures! then translated back to a compact representation.

This repo contains everything you need to build a super-cool robotics startup. ([shipfast](https://shipfa.st/) for robotics)
1. A react app for MMO-tele-operation + admin for ops, safety, understanding theory->practice.
2. A (react-native+livekit) app to code agents using on-device llm to gen correct prompts to auto-write infra+anything you want.
3. A deno server for server-side simulation, webgpu, and unity,unreal, nvidia omniverse integrations.
4. [sqlite+litestream for db](https://youtu.be/RqubKSF3wig?si=M6okGXrR_pyKB-8J) - + tailscale for connectivity + starlink for 5g in hard to reach places.
5. extra embedding infra for jetson-container-> $500 semi-autuonomous rosie for feeding cats.
