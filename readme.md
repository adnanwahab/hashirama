Alan Kay met with openai around 2016
Alan Kay talked about one other individual [Bret Victor](https://worrydream.com).
4. Bret's work has won the Apple Design Award twice.
5. Bret victor basically said, everything he did before  2014 was past even i thought it was futuristic.
7. But Bret Victor's newest creation - DynamicLand - is better than anything the world has seen. - Computers are a prison for our minds... compared to the DynamicLand.
8. DynamicLand = really cool
9. Build  many Dynamiclands = good idea.

Alan kay asked <a href="https://internetat50.com/references/Kay_How.pdf">HOW?</a>.

HARC was founded based on conversations between Alan Kay and Sam Altman of  ycr.org   -----  http://www.vpri.org/ - https://web.archive.org/web/20170914174755/https://harc.ycr.org/

train 1000 new {(web+ML30%) - 70% (hardware)} engineers because - only thing chatbot cannot do is glue together atoms and molecules.
also create 1000 new jobs for people who like working with their hands - (robotic technician, repair, and maintenance = infinite opporunity)

find the limiting reagnets - oct 12 - sapolsky

self-teaching course - no instructor, every student every other - like thestudio.yoga
