            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">Harness the power of machine learning to enhance cognitive capabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="px-6 py-4 bg-gray-50">
            <button class="bg-blue-500 text-white font-semibold py-2 px-4 rounded hover:bg-blue-700 transition duration-200">
